* ukko
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ukko
  :END:

ukko is a powerful static site generator written in Clojure. It transforms a directory of source files (like Markdown, Org-mode, or Fleet templates) with YAML frontmatter into a complete, static HTML website. ukko is designed to be data-driven and extensible, featuring:

- *Internationalization (i18n)*: Built-in support for multilingual websites with automatic URL translation
- *Blog functionality*: Complete blog system with categories, tags, RSS/Atom feeds
- *Data-driven generation*: Create pages dynamically from structured data
- *Multiple content formats*: Markdown, Org-mode, Fleet templates, SCSS, and 40+ formats via Pandoc
- *Development server*: Live reloading with file watching for rapid development
- *Flexible templating*: Fleet-based layouts with powerful context injection

ukko is published under AGPL-3.0 License.

** Installation

You have two options to install =ukko=.

*** Locally

    This is reasonable if you want to develop on =ukko= itself.

    Prerequisites:

    - [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]]
    - [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]]
    - rsync
    - pandoc (soon to be optional)
    - linkchecker (optional)
    - sassc (optional)
    - geckodriver (optional), or chromedriver or safari

    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Run =lein bin=.

*** Using Docker

     Premise: You have [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] installed.

     Copy/paste this into your shell and you will have a =~/bin/ukko= file.

 #+begin_src shell
 cat >> ~/bin/ukko <<EOF
 #!/bin/sh
 docker run -it --rm -v \`pwd\`:/project twohundredok/ukko /bin/bash -c "/bin/ukko \$@"
 EOF

 chmod +x ~/bin/ukko
 #+end_src

** Usage

Much like any other static site generator ukko collects information
from input files and generates and writes output files.

#+begin_quote
/:monocle_face:/ For brevity the documentation follows some general
typographic rules:

1. Keys (aka. properties) will be written in italics

2. Values will be written in code blocks (monospaced font)

3. Explanations will generally use the default values (in code blocks)
   with the corresponding key in parenthesis and italics

Here is an example:
#+end_quote

Output files are written to =public= /(target-path)/.

#+begin_quote
/:sunglasses:/ This means the path files are written to, here
=public=, can be changed by setting the option /target-path/ in
=ukko.yml=.
#+end_quote

ukko collects information from 5 locations:

- =ukko.yml=
- =assets= /(assets-path)/
- =site= /(site-path)/
- =layouts= /(layouts-path)/
- =data= /(data-path)/

*** Input =ukko.yml=

If present ukko reads the file =ukko.yml=, which can be used to
overwrite any global settings and defaults.

**** Global settings

  - /assets-path/, default: =assets=
  - /site-path/, default: =site=
  - /layouts-path/, default: =layouts=
  - /data-path/, default: =data=
  - /target-path/, default: =public=
  - /ignore-file-patterns/, default: =["^\\."]=
    - Changes to a file matching one of these patterns will not
      trigger a rebuild.
    - The default pattern ignores temporary files written by Emacs.
  - /linkcheck-params/, default: =nil=
    - Additional parameters that will be applied to =linkcheck= when
      running =ukko -l=.

**** Default settings

  - /target-extension/, default: =.html=
  - /format/, default: =passthrough=
  - /layout/, default: =[post, blog]=
  - /priority/, default: =50=

**** i18n settings (optional)

ukko includes comprehensive internationalization support for multilingual websites with a sophisticated three-tier URL translation system. *i18n support is completely optional* - ukko works seamlessly as a single-language static site generator when no i18n configuration is provided.

/Configuration:/
  - /i18n/default-locale/, e.g., =en=
    - The default language for the site
  - /i18n/locales/, e.g., =[en, de]=
    - List of all supported languages

/Content Translation Strategies:/

1. *Single Source, Multiple Outputs* (=i18n: generate-for-all-locales=):
   - One source file generates versions for all configured locales
   - Useful for content that doesn't vary by language structure
   - Automatically creates locale-specific URLs

2. *Linked Independent Files* (=translationKey=):
   - Separate content files for each language
   - Linked via shared =translationKey= in frontmatter
   - Enables different content structure per language

/Translation Files:/
Create translation files in =site/i18n/= directory (e.g., =en.yml=, =de.yml=) containing hierarchical key-value pairs for text used in shared templates.

/Template Integration:/
- Fleet template function: =<(i18n "landing.welcome")>=
- Pattern replacement: ={{ i18n "landing.welcome" }}=
- Language switcher: Built-in =language-switcher-html= function provides automatic navigation between translations

/URL Generation & Translation:/
The system uses a sophisticated three-tier approach for generating translated URLs:
1. *Explicit translationKey mapping*: Finds other artifacts with the same =translationKey= in the target locale
2. *Path structure inference*: Automatically converts =/en/about/= to =/de/about/= based on locale prefixes  
3. *Fallback to locale root*: Falls back to =/de/= if no translation is found

**** Additional settings

As the data provided by =ukko.yml= is easily accessible from any
template it may very well be used to provide any additional metadata
like:

  - /site-url/
  - /site-title/
  - ...

*** Input =assets=

All files in =assets= /(assets-path)/ are treated as ready-to-publish
and will be synced (via rsync) to =public= /(target-path)/ without any
further processing.

*** Input =site=

Files in =site= /(site-path)/, in ukko called "artifacts", are expected
to need processing before being published. Furthermore any file in
=site= /(site-path)/ is expected to provide a YAML front matter.

#+begin_quote
/:nerd_face:/ The concept of a [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/][YAML front matter]] was popularized by
the static site generator [[https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll][jekyll]], although [[https://github.com/TwP/webby][webby]] by Tim Pease had it
as early as 2008. Credit where credit is due!
#+end_quote

The YAML front matter is used to provide instructions on how to
process the artifact for publishing, as well as any additional
metadata. The front matter is closed with a YAML document separator
=---= (a line with only three dashes). The remainder of the file, after the
front matter, is called /template/.

#+begin_quote
/:monocle_face:/ It is not necessarily a template, it can also be just
content. In ukko it is still called /template/.
#+end_quote

The naming and location of the files in =site= /(site-path)/ generally
will be used to determine the naming and location in =public=
/(target-path)/. But as you'll see later there are exceptions to that
rule. Solely the file extension is irrelevant, as it will be replaced
with =.html= /(target-extension)/.

As the default /format/ is =passthrough= /(format)/ any file that does
not specify /format/ in its front matter explicitly will just have its
/template/ copied into its target location (/target-path/). It still
needs to have a front matter, though. Files in =site= that do not have
a valid front matter (invalid or none) will be ignored during
processing.

#+begin_quote
/:nerd_face:/ It is allowed to place files without front matter in
=site= /(site-path)/. For example files containing org fragments to be
included in other org files. In that case it is considered a feature
that these files due to the absence of a front matter will be ignored.
#+end_quote

Within ukko an artifact is represented as a Clojure map of its
front matter with the following additional keys

 - /path/ (the path to the source file)
 - /template/ (the content of the source file without the front matter)
 - /mtime/ (the date of last modification of the file as iso date string)

Here are some properties that control how artifacts are processed:

**** /format/

Formats transform the /template/. Available formats are:

  - =passthrough=
  - =md= (Markdown, via [[https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java][flexmark]])
  - =org= (org-mode, via [[https://emacs.org][Emacs]])
  - =fleet= (templating, via [[https://github.com/Flamefork/fleet][fleet]])
  - =scss= (via sassc)
  - All 40+ formats supported by [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-options][Pandoc]]

Formats can be chained. By providing a list of formats the template
can be passed through mulitple formats. This could for example be used
to generate Markdown from a Fleet template, which is then converted to
HTML.

#+begin_quote
/:nerd_face:/ Transforms are implemented with Clojure's multimethods
and thus are easily extendable. Pull requests are very welcome!
#+end_quote

**** /layout/

Layout specifies templates from =layouts= /(layouts-path)/ that will
be used the wrap the resulting html fragment. More about that in the
section about layouts.

**** /scope/

When using a templating /format/, like =fleet=, the template receives
a context "ctx" in which it is evaluated. Without setting /scope/ the
context is the global context with the current artifact merged.

#+begin_quote
/:nerd_face:/ This means that any property set in =ukko.yml= will act as
a default and any default can be overwritten by the artifact's
front matter.
#+end_quote

**** /priority/

Sometimes an artifact's /template/ depends on other artifacts. In this
case the order of processing is crucial. Artifacts are processed in
order of /priority/, and in case of equal /priority/ alphabetically. By
overwriting the default /priority/ of =50= with a higher value it can be
ensured that the given artifact is processed later.

**** /collection/

Collection is a powerful property that allows to render one /template/
into multiple output files. Collection is used to provide a list (or
vector, or map) of which each item results in its own output file.
There are several ways in which the value of /collection/ will be
interpreted, based on the type of value provided:

 - a vector (aka. YAML list)
 - a string (any YAML string)
 - a map (aka. YAML object)

A *vector* needs to be a list of Clojure keywords and will be used to
navigate the context as with [[https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/get-in][Clojure's get-in]]. It is mainly used to
drill down into the context, so this doesn't need to happen in the
template itself. The items of the structure retrieved with the
navigator will be the new context passed to the /template/.

A *string* is the most versatile way to define a /collection/, as the
string will be evaluated as Clojure code. The return value will be the
new context passed to the /template/.

A *map* will yield a cross-product of the values of the map
interpreted as navigators. The items if the collections will be
available in the cross-product items under the keys of the map. The
cross-product items will be the new context passed to the /template/.
This means that during processing any artifact that defines a
/collection/ will in fact be replaced by multiple artifacts, one for
each item in the /collection/. The /target-path/ of the new artifact
is relative to original artifact (it shares its path), but will be
derived from the /id/ of the item.

#+begin_quote
/:sunglasses:/ This will be your new SEO-Power-Tool.
#+end_quote

/Common Collection Use Cases:/

****** Blog Categories and Tags

Generate individual pages for each category or tag automatically using collection processing.

****** Data-Driven Pages

Create pages from structured data files, where each item in a data collection becomes its own page.

*** Input =layouts=

Layouts are handled much like artifacts in =site= /(site-path)/, but
-- as they are used to wrap html fragments generated by artifacts --
need to provide an actual /template/ using a templating /format/, like
=fleet=. (As opposed to artifacts, layouts can currently only be
transformed by one /format/.)

Layouts can be chained, much like formats. This means artifacts can
specify a list of layouts where the former will be wrapped by the
later. In other words layouts will be applied in the order they are
listed.

#+begin_quote
/:nerd_face:/ In fact by default /layout/ is defined as =[post, blog]=,
assuming that the majority of files in a typical setup will be blog
posts, so that when writing a blog post you can omit /layout/ and go
with the default.
#+end_quote

*** Input =data=

ukko uses [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/fsdb][fsdb]] to collect information from =data= /(data-path)/ and
thus supports the most common formats for structured data. It provides
what it finds as structured data via /data/ in the root context to any
template.

#+begin_quote
/:sunglasses:/ This in combination with /scope/ or /collection/ makes it
really powerful. Just imagine the possibilities.
#+end_quote

** Blog Features
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: blog-features
   :END:

ukko includes comprehensive blog functionality out of the box:

*** Categories and Tags

Organize your blog posts with categories and tags by adding them to your post frontmatter. Use collections to automatically generate category and tag pages.

*** RSS and Atom Feeds

Generate RSS and Atom feeds for your blog automatically using Fleet templates that filter and format your blog posts.

*** Sitemap Generation

Automatically generate XML sitemaps for SEO by creating Fleet templates that iterate over all artifacts and generate properly formatted sitemap entries.

*** Automatic Metadata

ukko automatically calculates useful metadata for blog posts:
- Word count
- Reading time estimation
- Excerpt generation
- Date formatting
- Schema.org structured data

All metadata is available in your templates for display and SEO optimization.

** Fleet Templating
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fleet-templating
   :END:

ukko uses [[https://github.com/Flamefork/fleet][Fleet]] as its primary templating engine, providing powerful template capabilities with full Clojure expression support.

*** Basic Syntax

Fleet supports expressions, value output, conditionals, and loops with full Clojure syntax integration.

*** Context Access

Templates receive a rich context with:
- *Current artifact*: All frontmatter properties (title, date-published, etc.)
- *Global config*: Properties from =ukko.yml= (site-url, site-title, etc.)
- *Data*: Structured data from =data/= directory via =data= key
- *All artifacts*: Access to other artifacts via =artifacts= key
- *Localized data*: =artifacts-by-locale= filtered for current language
- *i18n function*: Translation lookup for multilingual sites

*** Advanced Features

Fleet templates support language-aware filtering, cross-referencing content between artifacts, and complex data processing using the full power of Clojure expressions.

** Options
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: options
   :END:

ukko without any argument will generate the site, write it to =public=
(target-path) and quit. Additional features can be turned on by
passing arguments:

#+begin_example
  -c, --continuous       Regenerate site on file change
  -l, --linkcheck        After generating the site check links
  -p, --port PORT        Port for http server, default: 8080
  -f, --filter FILTER    Generate only files matching the regex FILTER
  -q, --quiet            Suppress output (not yet implemented)
  -s, --server           Run a http server
  -b, --browser BROWSER  Start a browser with live-reload (either firefox, chrome, or safari)
  -v, --verbose          Verbose output (not yet implemented)
  -d, --directory DIR    Specify the root directory of the Ukko project
#+end_example

*** Development Workflow

For rapid development with live reloading:
#+begin_example
ukko -d example -s -c -b firefox
#+end_example

This will:
- Start a development server on localhost:8080
- Watch for file changes and rebuild automatically
- Open Firefox with live-reload enabled
- Use the =example= directory as the project root

*** Browser

By default, your browser will start with an empty profile. Optionally,
if you want to start your browser with a specific profile (for example
for HiDPI settings or to include addons), you can set the profile in
an environment variable:

#+begin_example
FIREFOX_PROFILE=~/.mozilla/firefox/xmcjb934.geckodriver ukko -c -s -b firefox
#+end_example

**** Create and find a profile in Firefox

- Run Firefox with =-P=, =-p= or =-ProfileManager= key [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles][as the official
  page describes]].
- Create a new profile and run the browser.
- Setup the profile as you need.
- Open =about:support= page. Near the =Profile Folder= caption, press
  the =Show in Finder= button. A new folder window should appear. Copy
  its path from there.

**** Create and find a profile in Chrome

- In the right top corner of the main window, click on a user button.
- In the dropdown, select "Manage People".
- Click "Add person", submit a name and press "Save".
- The new browser window should appear. Now, setup the new profile as
  you want.
- Open =chrome://version/= page. Copy the file path that is beneath
  the =Profile Path= caption.

Check out the =example/= directory in this repository for a complete working example that demonstrates:

- *Multilingual blog*: English and German content with automatic URL translation
- *Internationalization*: Complete i18n setup with translation files and language switching
- *Blog functionality*: Categories, tags, RSS/Atom feeds, and sitemap generation
- *Advanced templating*: Fleet templates with complex data processing and filtering
- *SCSS styling*: Modern CSS with SCSS preprocessing
- *Data-driven pages*: Automatic generation of category and tag pages
- *SEO optimization*: Schema.org markup and metadata generation

To try the example:
#+begin_example
lein run -- -d example -s -c -b firefox
#+end_example

This starts a development server with:
- *English version*: http://localhost:8080/en/
- *German version*: http://localhost:8080/de/
- *Automatic redirects*: http://localhost:8080/ redirects to default locale
